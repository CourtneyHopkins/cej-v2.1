# CEJ v.2.1

This is a custom Wordpress theme that I designed and built for my personal portfolio site. My goal is to continuously improve myself so as I learn new skills, my personal website is a playground for me to practice and showcase what I learn.

To speed up this process, I am using the HTML5 <a href="http://themble.com/bones" target="_blank">Bones Wordpress Starter Theme Framework</a> which easily allows me to start coding without having to take the time to create the necessary files.
